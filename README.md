# Particle Simulations on a Raspberry PI Zero W?
 That's right. A little while back I found a fluid dynamics simulation library called [liquidfun](https://google.github.io/liquidfun/), a library created by some genius over at Google. It's backbone is an open source physics engine, [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) which is already a very powerful and lightweight physics engine. Box2D alone supports tons of features for making games, running smaller simulations and now with the addition of liquidfun, it supports particle dyanmics.
